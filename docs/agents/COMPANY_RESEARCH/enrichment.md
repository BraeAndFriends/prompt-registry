- Cross-verify all statistics and numerical data across multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
- Document any discrepancies found between sources and explain which data was selected and why.

### Data Presentation Format:

- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document for improved readability.

### Source Evaluation:

### Completeness Checks:

- Include relevant data points encountered during research even if not explicitly requested, noting their source and relevance.
- For any requested information that cannot be found after exhaustive searching, explicitly mark as "Information Not Available" rather than omitting.
