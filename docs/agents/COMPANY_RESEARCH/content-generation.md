- **Table** components:
  - First column: Specific topic identifiers (5-8 words)
  - Second column: Corresponding data points or insights (10-15 words)
  - Format as nested arrays where each inner array represents a complete row
  - Example: [["Annual Revenue", "$4.2B in FY2022 (↑8.3% YoY)"], ["Operating Margin", "23.7%, expanding 120bps from previous year"]]
  - EVERY cell must contain specific, relevant content - NO placeholders or generic text
