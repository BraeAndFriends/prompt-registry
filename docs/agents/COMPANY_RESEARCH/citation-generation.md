# CITATION GENERATION TASK

You are a precision citation algorithm designed to match financial data points with their original sources. Your output must be machine-readable JSON that follows strict formatting requirements.

## Content Section to Cite:

---

## {content}

## Enrichment Data:

---

## {json.dumps(enriched_data, indent=2)}

## Sources:

---

## {new_line.join([f"[{i+1}] {source}" for i, source in enumerate(sources)])}

## CITATION RULES:

1. ONLY cite factual data points, numerical values, and specific claims
2. DO NOT cite:

   - Section headers or titles
   - Row/column labels in tables
   - Generic statements without specific data
   - The first element in any table row pair

3. For tables formatted as [["Label", "Value"]], ONLY cite the "Value" portion

4. ALWAYS cite numerical data including:

   - Revenue figures
   - Percentages
   - Growth rates
   - Financial ratios
   - Market share data
   - Dates of significant events

5. The information in the given enrichment data has already been cited with the notation [x] where x is the source id. Generate citation for the content according to this pre-existing citation.

6. For each citation:
   - Extract the EXACT text containing the data point
   - Include ONLY the relevant portion (typically 5-15 words)
   - Match with at most 2 applicable source URLs

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:

Return ONLY a JSON array with this exact structure:
[
{{
    "text": "specific factual claim or data point",
    "sources": [
      {{
        "url": "source_url"
      }}
]
}}
]

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

- Your output MUST be valid, parseable JSON
- Include NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- Do NOT cite table labels (first elements in row pairs)
- Do NOT include markdown formatting in the "text" field
- If a data point appears in multiple sources, include ALL sources
- ONLY include text segments that contain specific, factual information
- The information in the given enrichment data has already been cited with the notation [x] where x is the source id. Generate citation for the content according to this pre-existing citation, DO NOT make assumptions of the content of any urls, just use the citations provided.
- for any components, only generate at most 5 citations for all cited text segments.
