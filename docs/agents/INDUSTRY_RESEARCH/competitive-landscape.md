Non-Negotiables

- Step 1 — Define Key Segments:
  - Break down the industry into logical segments (by product category, customer vertical, service model, or geography).
  - Each segment must be clearly named and strategically relevant.
- Step 2 — Identify Top Players in Each Segment:
  - Cover leaders, challengers, disruptors, and substitutes per segment.
  - Benchmark market shares and operational KPIs (stores, MAUs, fleet size, churn, CAC/LTV, margins).
  - Split company-reported KPIs vs analyst/market-share estimates.
- Step 3 — Synthesize Competitive Dynamics:
  - Summarize entry barriers, differentiation strategies, and substitution risks.
  - Provide 3–5 SAS headlines + rationale (VP-ready, banker tone).
- Clarity Standard: A Managing Director should quickly see industry segmentation, who matters in each segment, and how they compete.
