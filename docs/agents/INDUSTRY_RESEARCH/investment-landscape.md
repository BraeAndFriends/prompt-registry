One-Shot Example (Global Food Delivery Sector)

Key Drivers for M&A

- Scale economics and logistics efficiency drive consolidation: Acquirers seek market density to lower unit delivery costs and improve retention.
- Technology integration as competitive moat: Acquirers target platforms with strong data, routing, and payment capabilities.

Key Considerations from Acquirer

- Valuation discipline becomes critical: Revenue multiples compressed as focus shifts from growth to profitability.
- Integration and regulatory scrutiny as key risks: Market dominance invites antitrust review, while cross-border deals create operational friction.

Notable Acquirers

- Strategics dominate global consolidation: Uber, Delivery Hero, and DoorDash leverage equity currency to acquire scale.
- Sponsors selectively pursue platform plays: PE firms target regional delivery champions to roll up or exit via IPO.
