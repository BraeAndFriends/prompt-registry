        Output a json structure:
        - Company Name (identical to DEFINE)
        - Website (official)
        - URL (direct to main company profile or investor relations page if public)
        - Description: **Break down into bullet points** with:
          * One-liner business description
          * Key operational stats (e.g., locations, employees, market coverage, capacity)
          * Use clear, concise, banker-ready phrasing
        - Financials:
          * First define if the company is public or private
          * If public: pull directly from latest filings (10-K, annual report, etc.) — avoid news or third-party aggregators unless confirming
          * If private: use reputable sources in this order — (1) credible news outlets, (2) reputable third-party databases (e.g., Crunchbase, PitchBook)
          * Always cite source and include metrics like revenue, EBITDA, margin, growth rate, if available
        - Relevant M&A Transactions:
          * Only include transactions in relevant space (sector, geography, deal size range)
          * Highlight year, transaction value, and one-liner description of the target
        - Strategic Rationale:
          * **Bullet format**:
            (+) Positive rationale — what's the selling angle (synergies, existing presence, stated expansion plans, past deals indicating appetite)
            (-) Potential challenges or concerns (size mismatch, limited integration experience, market misalignment)
          * Ensure reasoning is grounded in sharp commercial judgment at VP/MD level
